## 1 Introduction
The `\IKG2021` folder contains the MATLAB implementations of the numerical experiments in Ding et al. (2021).
* `\IKG2021\Main`, contains codes for numerical experiments in Ding et al. (2021, ยง5).
The codes for the other compared polices are included in the folder `\IKG2021\Main\OtherPolicy`.
* The function `\IKG2021\Main\trandn.m` is a third-party function from Botev (2020).
* `\IKG2021\Addtional`, contains codes for numerical experiments in Ding et al. (2021, Appendix I).

## 2 Installation
The codes were written and run in MATLAB R2018b, on Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit OS,
with Intel i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60 GHz, 16 GB RAM.

To install the MATLAB codes, just copy the entire folder `\IKG2021` into your MATLAB directory, or change the path of MATLAB to the folder `\IKG2021`

## 3 Details on Numerical Experiments
### 3.1 Numerical Experiments in Ding et al. (2021, ยง5.1)
Get into folder `\Main`. Run the first and second sections of script `IKG_Experiments.m`. 
* Set parameter `density_type=1` for P1, and set parameter `density_type=2` for P2.
* The compared policies, *IKGwRC*, *BSE*, *PRS* are implemented in folder `\OtherPolicy`.
* The BSE policy needs to tune a parameter

which is conducted in script `TuneMforBSE.m`,
and intermediate results are saved in `BSE_regret_reduction.mat`. 

### 3.2 Numerical Experiments in Ding et al. (2021, ยง5.2)
Run the third section of script `IKG_Experiments.m` for P3.

### 3.3 Numerical Experiments in Ding et al. (2021, Appendix I)
Get into folder `\Addtional`.
* For the **Computational cost comparison** part, get into folder `\Addtional\CompuationCost` and open script `CompareWithSAA.m`, which is self-explanatory. This part involves manually and roughly tuning the sample size in step (i) of method 2, for each
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?{d=1,\ldots,7}">.
To do that, first fix a value of
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?{d}">,
then run the first and second sections with different value of `sample_size_ratio`, as explained there.
To directly check the computation time with our tuned values of `sample_size_ratio`, run the third section of `CompareWithSAA.m` to record the time and run the fourth section to plot.
Note that different computer configuration may require different time, but the comparison should be similar.

* For the **Estimated sampling variance** part, get into folder `\Addtional\EstimateVar` and open scripts `IKG_EstimateVar.m` and `noise_var.m`.
To consider the sampling variance (1) that is constant and sampling variance (2) that is varying, respectively,
just comment and uncomment the corresponding parts in `noise_var.m`, then run `IKG_EstimateVar.m` to see the comparison for

and
